# An Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for the TDVRPSO
### Karl Petter Ulsrud and Anders Vandvik

This repository contains the code for the ALNS algorithm outlined in our master's thesis conducted at NTNU during the spring of 2021.
The ALNS is adopted to solve the Time-Dependent Vessel Routing Problem with Speed Optimization (TDVRPSO) described in the thesis.
It is extended with a local search and a set-partitioning problem to improve solution quality.
The thesis can be found in [...]
